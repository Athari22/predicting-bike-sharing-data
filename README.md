# Predicting bike_sharing data
In this project, I built the neural network and used it to predict daily rental bike rides. Assisted by Udacity's as part of the Deep Learning Nanodegree. This neural network implementation in this project is the concept of forward and reverse propagation, stochastic gradient ratios, and hyperparameter interpretations.
